//A university has decided to open math courses and equip classrooms for 3 groups with special new desks.
//The faculty agreed that in the sake of productivity only two students may share one table.
//The enrolment has ended, and now the task is to count the number of desks to order the correct amount from the shop.
//Of course, the university is short of money, so you need to calculate the minimum of desks.
//But don't forget that each group will sit in its own classroom!
//The program receives the input of the three non-negative integers: the number of students in each of the three groups
//(the numbers is not bigger than 1000).
//
//Sample Input 1:
//20
//21
//22
//Sample Output 1:
//32
//
//Sample Input 2:
//16
//18
//20
//        
//Sample Output 2:
//27
